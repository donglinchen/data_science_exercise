 # Data Science Basics and Exercises

## 1. Data Science Project Life Cycle

### Business Understanding
- Identify business problems and define goals
- Identify data source that can help with answering questions, or need to collect more data?
- Define measurable success metrics, accuracy rate

### <font color='blue'>Data Acquisition and understanding</font>
- Extract and load the data
- Explore the data: statistics, distributions and correlations, noise and outliers, missing data...
- Process the data to produce a clean, high-quality data set

### <font color='blue'>Modeling</font>
- Feature engineering
- Model selection
- Model training and evaluation

### Deployment
- Provide model prediction through appliation API

### Customer acceptance
- System validateion
- User feedback

<font color='blue'> We focus on Data exploration, data processing, and modeling </font>


## 2. Data science tools and libraries
__Python__ - the programming langualge for data science community
- Since 1991
- Simple to use, easy to understand. scientific community use it to glue many different software components

__Numpy__ - highly efficient numarical array data operation with Python
- Since 1995
- Based on well-optimized C code, highly effifient for verctorized numarical computation
- Brings the computational power of languages like C and Fortran to Python, a language much easier to learn and use https://numpy.org

__Matplotlib__ - Visulaization tool for python
- Since 2003
- A plotting library for python and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy
- Provides a MATLAB-like interface for python, being free and open-source
- Anatomy of a figure: https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/usage.html#parts-of-a-figure
- Gallery and code https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html

__Pandas__ - Data analysis and manipulation tool for python
- Since 2008
- Data manipulation and analysis library for python wiritten in Python, Cython, and C

__Scikit Learn__ - Machine Learning in Python
- Since 2007
- Provides simple API for various classification, regression and clustering algorithms https://scikit-learn.org/stable/

__Jupyter Notebook__ - interactive development interface and collaboration tool for data scientist
- Since 2015
- The open source web application used by data scientist to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text

<font color='blue'> At this moment, we will skip SciPy for our data science exercises</font></br>
__Scipy__ - Fundamental algorithms for scientific computing in Python
- Since 2001
- Builds on Numpy, provides comprehensive scientific computation functions.
